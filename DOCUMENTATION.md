📄 Project Documentation – Film & Anime Resource Hub
1. Introduction

The Film & Anime Resource Hub is a full-stack web application designed to allow users to upload, download, search, and rate film and anime-related resources such as scripts, fan art, and episode guides.

The platform provides a centralized hub for fans, researchers, and creators to share content, collaborate, and discover resources using intelligent tagging and search mechanisms.

2. Objectives

Provide a secure platform with user authentication.

Allow users to upload and download resources easily.

Implement a tagging and search system to quickly locate resources.

Provide a rating system for community-driven quality evaluation.

Maintain clean UI/UX for accessibility and ease of use.

3. Technology Stack
Frontend

React.js – UI framework

React Router – Navigation

Axios – API communication

Tailwind CSS (optional) – Styling

Backend

Node.js + Express.js – REST API server

Multer – File upload handling

bcrypt.js – Password hashing

jsonwebtoken (JWT) – Authentication

Database

MongoDB (Mongoose ODM) – Store users, resources, tags, ratings

4. System Architecture

Client (React) ↔ Server (Express) ↔ Database (MongoDB)

Frontend

Handles authentication forms, upload form, search bar, and resource display.

Communicates with backend using REST API via Axios.

Backend

Provides endpoints for authentication, file upload/download, search, and rating.

Handles JWT authentication and request validation.

Database

User Collection → Stores user info (username, email, hashed password).

Resource Collection → Stores metadata (title, tags, uploader, rating, file path).

Supports indexing for faster search.

5. Core Features
5.1 User Authentication

Register new users with username, email, and password.

Login users with JWT token authentication.

Secure password storage using bcrypt.

5.2 Upload & Download Resources

Users can upload scripts, fan art, guides.

Files stored in server uploads/ directory.

Metadata (tags, uploader, title) stored in MongoDB.

Users can download resources securely.

5.3 Tagging System

Resources tagged by genre, studio, release year, characters, actors, or directors.

Stored as array in MongoDB → e.g. ["Action", "Studio Ghibli", "2020"].

5.4 Intelligent Search

Search resources by title, tags, actor, or director.

MongoDB text indexes enable fast queries.

5.5 Rating System

Users can rate resources 1–5 stars.

Average rating calculated dynamically.

Helps highlight best content.

6. API Documentation

POST /api/auth/login → Login and receive JWT token

Resource Management

POST /api/resources/upload → Upload file (auth required)

GET /api/resources/search?q=keyword → Search resources

GET /api/resources/:id/download → Download file

POST /api/resources/:id/rate → Rate resource (auth required)

7. UI/UX Design
Pages

Home Page – Search bar + list of resources

Upload Page – Upload form for new resources

Login/Register – User authentication forms

Resource Page – Displays resource info, download link, rating option

Navigation

Navbar with links: Home | Upload | My Resources | Login/Register

8. Installation & Setup
